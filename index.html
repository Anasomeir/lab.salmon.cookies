<h2>Our Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies began with two visionary founders: grow expert Jai, and entrepreneur Berner, whose Girl Scout Cookies (GSC) remains one of the most sought-after cannabis strains in the world. From the earliest days in a San Francisco garage to global growth, our goal has remained the same: authenticity and innovative genetics.

    Our control of the entire experience from start to finish, seed to sale, sets us apart. We take pride in our in-house cultivation, global varieties, and full lineup of strain-specific products. Cookies is a lifestyle. Join the community as we take it worldwide.s

<h2>Safety is
    Our priority</h2>
We thank you for your continued support. The safety and well-being of our team, customers, and communities remain our top priority.

As state and local governments begin to ease restrictions, we are taking steps to maintain safe and comfortable environments for our customers and employees.

In the meantime, you can still enjoy Great American Cookies, as many of our stores remain open for delivery and carryout.
